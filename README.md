# ProgressTracker
Firebase Cloud function to track the progress of your projects in BigQuery.

This is a simple implementation of the TypeScript cloud function, which saves numerical value into a database, which then can be connected to tools like [Google Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/).

Part of this code was written by ChatGPT and Github Copilot, mostly to present how these tools can help you with creating such projects. 

This project intends to build a simple solution within less than a day, which is easy to maintain but doesn't necessarily scale well. If, as an engineering leader, you don't have progress-tracking solutions already in your toolset, this project should be enough to start working with many, if not the majority, of goals that require some tracking.
